I. 	Terms of Use

These projections are being distributed to interested users for consideration 
in research and planning applications. Such applications may include any 
project carried out by an individual or organized by a university, a 
scientific institute, public agency, or private sector entity for research or 
planning purposes. Any decision to use these projections is at the interested 
user's discretion and subject to the Disclaimer provided below.

II. 	Disclaimer

These projections are being made available to provide immediate access for 
the convenience of interested persons. They are being made available by 
Archive Collaborators (i.e. Bureau of Reclamation, California-Nevada Climate 
Applications Program, Climate Analytics Group, Cooperative Institute for 
Research in Environmental Sciences, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 
National Center for Atmospheric Research, Santa Clara University, Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center, 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and U.S. Geological Survey). Archive 
Collaborators believe the information to be correct representations of 
potential high-resolution climate/hydrologic variations and changes subject 
to the limitations of the CMIP3 and CMIP5 global climate simulations, and the 
downscaling methods and their limitations, as described elsewhere in this web 
site. However, human and mechanical errors remain possibilities. Therefore, 
Archive Collaborators do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, 
timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information. Also, neither Archive 
Collaborators, nor any of the sources of the information shall be responsible 
for any errors or omissions, or for the use or results obtained from the use 
of this information.

III. Acknowledgements and Citation of these Projections

Whenever you publish research based on projections from this archive, please
include two acknowledgements:

1. First, acknowledge the superceding effort.

a. For CMIP3, the following is language suggested by the CMIP3 archive hosts 
at PCMDI: "We acknowledge the modeling groups, the Program for Climate Model 
Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) and the WCRP's Working Group on Coupled 
Modelling (WGCM) for their roles in making available the WCRP CMIP3 
multi-model dataset. Support of this dataset is provided by the Office of 
Science, U.S. Department of Energy." PCMDI also requests that in first making 
reference to the projections from this archive, please first reference the 
CMIP3 dataset by including the phrase "the World Climate Research Programme's 
(WCRP's) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) multi-model 
dataset". Subsequent references within the same publication might refer to 
the CMIP3 data with terms such as "CMIP3 data", "the CMIP3 multi-model 
dataset", "the CMIP3 archive", or the "CMIP3 dataset".

b. For CMIP5, , the model output should be referred to as "the CMIP5 
multi-model ensemble [archive/output/results/of simulations/dataset/ ...]". 
In publications, you should include a table (referred to below as Table XX) 
listing the models and institutions that provided model output used in your 
study. In this table and as appropriate in figure legends, you should use the 
CMIP5 "official" model names found in "CMIP5 Modeling Groups and their Terms 
if Use" (pdf document, also in Word doc format). In addition, an 
acknowledgment similar to the following should be included in your publication:

"We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on 
Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate 
modeling groups (listed in Table XX of this paper) for producing and making 
available their model output. For CMIP the U.S. Department of Energy's 
Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison provides coordinating 
support and led development of software infrastructure in partnership with 
the Global Organization for Earth System Science Portals."

where, "Table XX" in your paper should list the models and modeling groups 
that provided the data you used. In addition it may be appropriate to cite 
one or more of the CMIP5 experiment design articles listed on the CMIP5 
reference page.

2. Second, generally acknowledge this archive as "Downscaled CMIP3 and CMIP5
