# climatechange-in-colorado
Datasets and code used to conduct analyses presented in the 2023 Climate Change in Colorado report, available at [https://climatechange.colostate.edu].

Figures in the report (and the associated code included here) were variously generated in Python, R, Matlab, and Excel. 

For figures generated in python, Jupyter notebooks are included here. A number of packages are required to reproduce these plots, all of which are open source and available for installation via conda or pip. These include:

```
- matplotlib
- xarray
- cartopy
- numpy
- metpy
- plotly
- scipy
- pandas
- pymannkendall
- palettable
```
